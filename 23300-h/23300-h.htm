INTRODUCTION ON THE USE OF THE MAPS.</h2>

<hr>

<p class="indent">
It is very easy to gain a knowledge of the stars, if the learner
sets to work in the proper manner. But he commonly meets with a
difficulty at the outset of his task. He provides himself with a
set of the ordinary star-maps, and then finds himself at a loss
how to make use of them. Such maps tell him nothing of the position
of the constellations <i>on the sky</i>. If he happen to recognize
a constellation, then indeed his maps, if properly constructed,
will tell him the names of the stars forming the constellation,
and also he may be able to recognize a few of the neighboring
constellations. But when he has done this he may meet with a new
difficulty, even as respects this very constellation. For if he
look for it again some months later, he will neither find it in
its former place nor will it present the same aspect,&mdash;if
indeed it happen to be above the horizon at all.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is clear, then, that what the learner wants is a set of maps
specially constructed to show him in what part of the sky the
constellations are to be looked for. He ought on any night of the
year to be able to turn at once to the proper map, and in that
map he ought to see at once what to look for, toward what point
of the compass each visible constellation lies, and how high it
is above the horizon. And, if possible (as the present work shows
is the case), <i>one</i> map ought to suffice to exhibit the aspect
of the whole heavens, in order that the beginner may not be confused
by turning from map to map, and trying to find out how each fits
in with the others.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is to fulfil these requirements that the present maps have been
constructed. Each exhibits the aspect of the whole sky at a given
day and hour. The circumference of the map represents the natural
horizon, the middle of the map representing the part of the sky
which lies immediately overhead. If the learner hold one of these
maps over his head, so as to look vertically upwards at it, the
different parts of the horizon marked in round the circumference
being turned towards the proper compass points, he will see the
same view of the heavens as he would if he were to lie on his back
and look upwards at the sky, only that the map is a planisphere
and the sky a hemisphere.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But although this illustration serves to indicate the nature of
the maps, the actual mode of using them is more convenient.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Let it first be noted that properly speaking the maps have neither
top, bottom, nor sides. Each map may be held with any part of the
circumference downward: then the centre of the map is to be looked
upon as the top for that part of the circumference. The portion
of the map lying beneath the centre represents the portion of the
sky lying between the point overhead and a certain part of the
horizon&mdash;the part in fact corresponding to the particular
part of the circumference which is turned downwards. Thus if on
any night we wish to learn what are the stars towards the north,
we look for the map corresponding to that night. At the hour named
the stars toward the north will be those shown between the centre
of the map and the top; and, of course, <a name="page_2"><span
class="page">Page 2</span></a> we hold the map upside down so as
to bring the centre above the northern part of the circumference.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But this matter will be more clearly understood by comparing the
account of any of the accompanying maps with the map itself.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Again, it must be noted that, although the maps are necessarily
arranged in a certain order, there is in reality no first or last
in the series. The map numbered I. follows the map numbered XII.
in exactly the same manner that the latter follows the map numbered
XI. The maps form a circular series, in fact.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The only reason for numbering the maps as at present, is that the map
numbered I. Happens to exhibit the aspect of the sky at a convenient
hour on the night of January 1st. It will be found that the dates
follow on with intervals of seven or eight days right round the year,
the end of the year falling in the left-hand column of the table
under Map I., while the beginning of the year is in the right-hand
column of the same map.[*]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: It may be mentioned in passing, that the dates have
not been thrown in so as to fall regularly round the year, but
correspond with the variations due to the earth's variable motion
round the sun.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
It will be seen at once that a map can always be found corresponding
to a convenient hour on any night of the year. (In midsummer, on
a few of the dates mentioned under the maps, night has not begun
at the hour named.) On any date named under a map, the aspect of
the sky two hours later than that named is that represented in
the following map. Thus at eight o'clock in the evening of January
22d, the aspect of the stars is as shown in Map I. At ten o'clock
on the same night the aspect of the sky is that shown in Map II., as
a date under that map shows. Applying this rule to the few occasions
on which the hour named is not available for observation (five or
six in all out of ninety-six dates), the observer can manage as
well for those occasions as for any others.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Next, as to finding the north point, or any point of the compass
which will enable the observer to determine the rest. If he is
only familiar with the aspect of those seven bright stars of the
Great Bear which have been called the Dipper, Charles' Wain, (really
"The Churl's Wain,") the Butcher's Cleaver, and by other names,
he can always determine the north point by means of the two stars
called the Pointers, since these seven stars never set. In the
explanation of each map I have shown where the Great Bear is to
be looked for on each night, the observer being assumed to have
such a general knowledge of the direction of the compass-points,
as will suffice for the purpose of finding so marked a collection
of stars. Thus the pole-star is found, and for the purpose of such
observations as are here considered, this star may be looked upon
as marking the exact direction of the north.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Perhaps nothing further is required; but if the observer prefer
it he can determine the north point conveniently <i>at noon</i> by
setting up a vertical stick in the sunlight and noting the direction
in which the shadow lies. Once the observation has been made, he
can note what objects (these should be distant) lie towards the
different points of the compass, and from that time he can use
the accompanying maps without any reference to the Great Bear and
the Pointers.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is worth noticing that the stars called the Guardians of the
Pole form no bad time-piece when used with the aid of such maps
as the present. They revolve round the pole once in twenty-four
hours (less about four minutes), in a direction contrary to that of
a clock's hands. But stars near the equator, whose motions are much
more rapid, afford a yet better measure of time, if the direction
of the south point is well determined.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_3"><span class="page">Page 3</span></a> Of course,
the observer who really wishes to become an astronomer will not
rest satisfied by learning only the principal stars shown in these
maps. By means of the regular star-maps, such as those of my School
Star Atlas, he will be able to explore the depths of all the
constellations, having once learned their position and general
appearance from the accompanying maps. It will be well for the
student to remember that the planets Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn will at times appear among the constellations here shown.
Venus and Jupiter can always be recognized by their superior light,
Mars and Saturn by the steadiness with which they shine. The almanac
will always show when these planets and Mercury (often very bright
in the clear skies of America) are above the horizon, and where
they are situate. They never appear except among the zodiacal
constellations.

NIGHT SKY.&mdash;DECEMBER AND JANUARY.</h2>

<hr>

<p class="indent">
The Great Bear (<i>Ursa Major</i>) is now rising well above the
horizon, in the northeast, the Pointers about midway between north
and northeast. A line from the Pole Star to the Guardians of the
Pole is now in the position of the minute hand of a clock about
28 minutes past an hour. The Dragon (<i>Draco</i>) lies due north,
curving round under the Little Bear, its head close to the horizon.
Low down in the northwest is a part of the Swan (<i>Cygnus</i>).
Higher up we see King Cepheus, his wife <i>Cassiopeia</i>, and
their daughter <i>Andromeda</i> (the Seated Lady and Chained Lady,
respectively), with the Rescuer (<i>Perseus</i>) nearly overhead.
The Winged Horse is setting, his head close by the western horizon,
and near the jar of the Water Bearer (<i>Aquarius</i>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the southwest is the Whale; and close by, the constellation
<i>Pisces</i>, or the Fishes; above them the Ram (<i>Aries</i>),
between which and <i>Andromeda</i> the Triangles can be seen.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the south the River (<i>Eridanus</i>) makes now its best show.
Its leading brilliant, <i>Achernar</i>, is, however, never seen in
the United States. In the southeast the Great Dog, with the splendid
Sirius ("which brightliest shines when laved of ocean's wave"),
shows resplendently. Above is Orion now standing upright, treading
on the Hare (<i>Lepus</i>) and facing the Bull (<i>Taurus</i>),
now at its highest. The Dove (<i>Columba</i>) below the Hare is a
modern and not very interesting constellation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Little Dog (<i>Canis Minor</i>) is on the east of Orion. In
the east the Sea Serpent (<i>Hydra</i>) is rising, and due east
a little higher we find <i>Cancer</i>, the Crab, (note the pretty
cluster called the Beehive (<i>Pr&oelig;sepe</i>)); above are the
twins (<i>Gemini</i>), and above them the Charioteer (<i>Auriga</i>),
with the bright <i>Capella</i>, nearly overhead.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Lion is rising in the northeast, his heart star <i>Regulus</i>
(&alpha;) being low down a little north of east.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Lastly, due north, high up, the absurd Giraffe (<i>Camelopardus</i>)
stands proudly on his ridiculous head.
</p>

<h2><a name="page_8"><span class="page">Page 8</span></a>
NIGHT SKY.&mdash;JANUARY AND FEBRUARY.</h2>

<hr>

<p class="indent">
The Great Bear (<i>Ursa Major</i>) with its Dipper and Pointers,
occupies the northeasterly mid-heaven. A line from the Pole Star
(&alpha; of the Little Bear, <i>Ursa Minor</i>) to the Guardians,
&beta; and &gamma;, lies in the position of the minute hand of a
clock 23 minutes after an hour. The Camelopard (<i>Camelopardus</i>)
is above. The Dragon (<i>Draco</i>), whose head is below the horizon,
curves round the Little Bear to between the Guardians and the Pointers.
In the northwest, fairly high up, we find <i>Cassiopeia</i>, the
Seated Lady, and on her right, lower down, the inconspicuous
constellation <i>Cephius</i>. <i>Andromeda</i>, the Chained Lady,
is on <i>Cassiopeia's</i> left. The Great Nebula will be noticed
in the map&mdash;it is faintly visible to the naked eye. Above
<i>Andromeda</i> is <i>Perseus</i>, the Rescuing Knight, and above
him the Charioteer (<i>Auriga</i>), nearly overhead. On the left of
<i>Andromeda</i> is <i>Aries</i>, the Ram, the small constellation
the Triangles lying between them.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Toward the southwest, the Whale (<i>Cetus</i>) is beginning to
set. The River (<i>Eridanus</i>) occupies the lower part of the
southwesterly sky, and extends also to the mid-heavens in that
direction. The Dove (<i>Columba</i>) is nearly due south, and at
its best&mdash;which is not saying much. Above is the Hare
(<i>Lepus</i>), on which <i>Orion</i> treads. The Giant now presents
his noblest aspect&mdash;prince of all the constellations as he is.
He faces the Bull (<i>Taurus</i>), known by the <i>Pleiades</i>
and the bright <i>Aldebaran</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Close by the poor Hare, on the left, leaps <i>Canis Major</i>,
the Greater Dog, with the bright Sirius, which "bickers into green
and emerald." The stern of the Star Ship (<i>Argo</i>) is nearing
the south.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Very high in the southeast we find the Twins (<i>Gemini</i>), with
the twin stars, <i>Castor</i> and <i>Pollux</i> (&alpha; and &beta;);
and below them the Little Dog (<i>Canis Minor</i>). The Sea Serpent
(<i>Hydra</i>) is rearing its tall neck above the eastern horizon
(by south), as if aiming either for the Little Dog or for the Crab
(<i>Cancer</i>), now high up in the east, with its pretty Beehive
cluster showing well in clear weather. The Lion (<i>Leo</i>) is
due east, the Sickle (marked by the stars &alpha;, &eta;, &gamma;,
&mu;, and &epsilon;) being easily recognized.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Queen Berenice's Hair (<i>Coma Berenices</i>, not <i>Berenicis</i>,
as often ignorantly given) is in the northeast. It used to mark the
tip of the real Lion's tail, just as the stars of the Crab marked
his head. The Hunting Dogs occupy the space between Berenice's
Hair and the Great Bear.

<p class="indent">
The Great Bear (<i>Ursa Major</i>), with its Dipper and Pointers,
is now high up in the northeastern sky. The Pointers direct us to
the Pole Star, (&alpha; of the Little Bear <i>Ursa Minor</i>).
A line from the Pole Star to the Guardians of the Pole (&beta;
and &gamma;) lies in the position of the minute hand of a clock
18 minutes after an hour. The Dragon (<i>Draco</i>) extends from
between the Bears to the horizon&mdash;east of north&mdash;where
its head with its two bright eyes can be seen.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Cepheus</i> is low down, somewhat to the west of north; his
Queen (<i>Cassiopeia</i>) the Seated Lady, beside him (&alpha;
and &beta; mark the top rail of her chair's back); while above
her lies the poor constellation <i>Camelopardus</i>, the Giraffe.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Andromeda</i>, the Chained Lady, is in the northwest, low
down&mdash;in fact, partly set; the Triangles and the Ram (<i>Aries</i>)
beside her, toward the west. Above them is <i>Perseus</i>, the
Rescuing Knight; and above him, somewhat to the west, the Charioteer
(<i>Auriga</i>). The Bull (<i>Taurus</i>), with the <i>Pleiades</i>
and the bright <i>Aldebaran</i>, is in the mid-heaven, due west;
<i>Gemini</i>, the Twins, higher, and toward the southwest.
<i>Orion</i>, below them, is already slanting toward "his grave,
low down in the west"; beneath him the Hare, and in the southwest
a part of the River (<i>Eridanus</i>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
Due south is a part of the Star Ship (<i>Argo</i>), beside which,
low down, is the foolish Dove (<i>Columba</i>), while above leaps
the Great Dog (<i>Canis Major</i>), with the splendid <i>Sirius</i>,
chief of all the stars in the sky, marking his mouth.
</p>

<p class="indent">
High up, a little west of north, is the Little Dog (<i>Canis Minor</i>);
and higher, a little east of north, the Crab (<i>Cancer</i>), the
"dark constellation," as it was called of old, with the pretty
cluster <i>Pr&oelig;sepe</i>, or the Beehive.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Sea Serpent (<i>Hydra</i>) is rearing his long neck high above
the horizon, bearing on his back, absurdly enough, Noah's Cup
(<i>Crater</i>) and Noah's Raven or Crow (<i>Corvus</i>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
Nearly due east, the Virgin (<i>Virgo</i>) has risen, Spica shining
brightly just above the horizon. The Lion (<i>Leo</i>) occupies
the mid-space above; the "Sickle in the Lion"&mdash;its handle
marked by &eta; and &alpha;, its curved blade by &gamma;, &mu;, and
&epsilon;&mdash;will at once be recognized. The Hair of Queen Berenice
(<i>Coma Berenices</i>) is nearly due east, and fairly high. Between
this small but remarkable group and the Great Bear, lies Hevelius's
foolish constellation, the Hunting Dogs (<i>Canes Venatici</i>).
Lastly, in the northeast, the Herdsman (<i>Bo&ouml;tes</i>), with
the orange-yellow brilliant, Arcturus, is rising, though at present,
paradoxical as it may seem, he lies on his back.

<p class="indent">
The Great Bear (<i>Ursa Major</i>) is now nearing the point overhead,
the Pointers (&alpha; and &beta;) aiming almost directly downward
toward the Pole Star. The line from this star (&alpha; of the Little
Bear, <i>Ursa Minor</i>) to the Guardians (&beta; and &gamma;) is
now in the position of the minute hand of a clock about 13 minutes
after an hour.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Cepheus</i> lies north, low down, <i>Cassiopeia</i> on his left,
the Camelopard above her, <i>Andromeda</i> just setting, almost due
northwest, on the left. <i>Perseus</i> is due northwest, rather
low, the Charioteer (<i>Auriga</i>) on his left, but higher. Setting
between west and northwest we see the Bull (<i>Taurus</i>), with
the <i>Pleiades</i> and the ruddy <i>Aldebaran</i>. <i>Orion</i>
is almost prone in his descent toward his western grave. The Twins
(<i>Gemini</i>) are due west, in the mid-heavens; the Little Dog
(<i>Canis Minor</i>) beside them on their left, the Crab (<i>Cancer</i>)
above, the Greater Dog (<i>Canis Major</i>) below, chasing the Hare
(<i>Lepus</i>) below the horizon. Just behind the Dog the poop of
the Great Ship (<i>Argo</i>) is also setting.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Sea Serpent (<i>Hydra</i>) now shows his full length, rearing
his head high in the south. Observe the darkness of the region
around his heart, marked by the star &alpha;, <i>Alfard</i>, the
Solitary One. The Cup (<i>Crater</i>) and Crow (<i>Corvus</i>)
stand on his back.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Sickle in the Lion (<i>Leo</i>) now stands with handle upright,
due south. Below the tail stars of the Lion we see the Virgin
(<i>Virgo</i>), with the bright <i>Spica Azimech</i>. The set of
five third magnitude stars, above, was called by the Arabs, for
reasons not explained, the "Retreat of the Howling She Dog."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Behind the Lion, due east and high up, we see <i>Coma Berenices</i>,
the hair of Queen Berenice, between which and the tail of the Great
Bear we see in the chart one star only of the Hunting Dogs (<i>Canes
Venatici</i>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Herdsman (<i>Bo&ouml;tes</i>), still on his back, pursues in
that striking and effective position the Great Bear. Below the
shoulder stars of the Herdsman we see the Crown (<i>Corona
Borealis</i>), near which, on the right, low down and due east,
the head of the Serpent (<i>Serpens</i>) is rising. <i>Hercules</i>
is also rising, but in the northeast.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Lastly, the stars of the Dragon (<i>Draco</i>) can be seen curving
from between the Pointers and the Pole, round the Little Bear,
then back toward <i>Hercules</i>, the head of the Dragon, with
the bright eyes, &beta; and &gamma;, being rather low down, and
somewhat north of northeast.

Crab (<i>Cancer</i>), below which is the Little Dog (<i>Canis
Minor</i>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
The southwestern sky is very barren of bright stars. <i>Alfard</i>,
the heart of the Sea Serpent, <i>Hydra</i>, shines here alone in a
great blank space. Above the Sea Serpent's head we see the Sickle
in the Lion, <i>Leo</i> himself stretching his tail to due south,
very high up. <i>Coma Berenices</i> is close by, and the Hunting
Dogs (<i>Canes Venatici</i>) between <i>Coma</i> and the Great
Bear.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the south, lower down, we find the Crow (<i>Corvus</i>), and the
Cup (<i>Crater</i>), on the Serpent's back; the Virgin (<i>Virgo</i>),
extending in the mid-heavens from southeast to south, between the
Lion's tail and the Crow. In the same direction, but low down, we
find the head and body of the Centaur (<i>Centaurus</i>), supposed
to have typified the patriarchal Noah.
</p>

an offering for the Altar (<i>Ara</i>), which, however, is invisible
in these latitudes. Above the Wolf we see the Scales (<i>Libra</i>),

<p class="indent">
The Great Bear (<i>Ursa Major</i>) is in the mid-heavens toward
the northwest, the Pointers not far from the horizontal position.
They direct us to the Pole Star (&alpha; of the Little Bear, <i>Ursa
Minor</i>). The line from this star to the Guardians of the Pole,
&beta; and &gamma;, is in about the position of the minute hand
of a clock 2 minutes before an hour. The Dragon (<i>Draco</i>)
curls over the Little Bear, curving upward on the east, to where
its head, high up in the northeast, is marked by the gleaming eyes,
&beta; and &gamma;. Under the Little Bear, the Camelopard has at
last come upright.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Low down in the west the Lion (<i>Leo</i>) is setting. The point of
the "Sickle in the Lion" is turned toward the horizon; the handle
(marked by &alpha; and &eta;) is nearly horizontal. Above the Lion's
tail is Berenice's Hair (<i>Coma Berenices</i>); and between that
and the Great Bear's tail our chart shows a solitary star of the
Hunting Dogs (<i>Canes Venatici</i>). The Crow (<i>Corvus</i>)
is low down in the southwest, the Cup (<i>Crater</i>) beside it,
partly set, on the right. Above is <i>Virgo</i>, the Virgin. Still
higher in the southwest&mdash;in fact, with head close to the point
overhead&mdash;is the Herdsman (<i>Bo&ouml;tes</i>), the Crown
(<i>Corona Borealis</i>) near his southern shoulder marking what
was once the Herdsman's uplifted arm.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Low down between the south and southwest we find the head and shoulders
of the Centaur (<i>Centaurus</i>), who holds the Wolf (<i>Lupus</i>)
due south. Above the Wolf are the Scales (<i>Libra</i>), and above
these the Serpent (<i>Serpens</i>), his head in the south, stretching
toward the Crown. In the mid-sky, toward the southeast, we find
the Serpent Bearer (<i>Ophiuchus</i>&mdash;one star of the Serpent
lies east of him). Below the Serpent Bearer we find the Scorpion
(<i>Scorpio</i>), now fully risen, and showing truly scorpionic
form. Beside the Scorpion is the Archer (<i>Sagittarius</i>), low
down in the southeast. To his left we see, low down, two stars
marking the head of the Sea Goat (<i>Capricornus</i>), and one
belonging to the Water Bearer (<i>Aquarius</i>). Above the Sea Goat
flies the Eagle (<i>Aquila</i>), with the bright star <i>Altair</i>;
and above, near the point overhead, is the kneeling <i>Hercules</i>.
Due east, we see part of the Winged Horse (<i>Pegasus</i>); above
that, the little Dolphin (<i>Delphinus</i>), and higher, the Swan
(<i>Cygnus</i>) and the Lyre (<i>Lyra</i>), with the beautiful
bluish-white star <i>Vega</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Lastly, low down, between north and northeast, we find the Seated
Lady (<i>Cassiopeia</i>); and above, somewhat eastwardly, the
inconspicuous constellation <i>Cepheus, Cassiopeia's</i> royal husband.
</p>

The Great Bear (<i>Ursa Major</i>) is now in the northwest, his
paws near the horizon. The Pointers (&alpha; and &beta;) direct us
to the Pole Star, (&alpha; of the Little Bear, <i>Ursa Minor</i>).
A line from the Pole Star to the Guardians of the Pole is in the
position of the minute hand of a clock about 7 minutes before an
hour. Below the Little Bear we see the Camelopard, a little to
the east of due north. The Dragon (<i>Draco</i>) curves round from
between the Pointers and the Pole, above the Little Bear toward
the east, then upward to near the point overhead, its head, with
the bright stars &beta; and &gamma;, being highest. Low down in
the west we see Berenice's Hair (<i>Coma Berenices</i>), and one
star of the Hunting Dogs (<i>Canes Venatici</i>) is seen in the
chart between <i>Coma</i> and the Great Bear. The Herdsman
{<i>Bo&ouml;tes</i>) occupies the mid-heaven in the west, the Crown
(<i>Corona Borealis</i>) higher up, and due west, Hercules, between
the Crown and the point overhead.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Low down, extending from the west to near the southwest, we find
the Virgin (<i>Virgo</i>), the bright <i>Spica</i> near its setting
place. In the southwest are the Scales (<i>Libra</i>), and farther
to the left, extending from the Scales to low down near the south,
we find the Scorpion (<i>Scorpio</i>), one of the finest of the
constellations, <i>Antares</i>, the rival of Mars (as the name
means), marking its heart. Above the Scorpion and the Scales are
the Serpent Bearer (<i>Serpentarius</i> or <i>Ophiuchus</i>) and
the Serpent (<i>Serpens</i>), extending right across him to near
the Crown, after which the Serpent seems reaching.
</p>

<p class="indent">
A little east due south, low down, we find the Archer
(<i>Sagittarius</i>); in the southeast, low down, the Sea Goat
(<i>Capricornus</i>); and farther east, and lower down, the Water
Bearer (<i>Aquarius</i>). Above the Sea Goat is the Eagle
(<i>Aquila</i>), with the bright bluish-white star <i>Altair</i>;
on its left the pretty little Dolphin (<i>Delphinus</i>), and above
the Dolphin, nearly overhead, the Lyre (<i>Lyra</i>), with the
bluish-white star <i>Vega</i> (even brighter than <i>Altair</i>)
nearly overhead.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Below the Lyre we see the Swan (<i>Cygnus</i>), due east; and below
the Swan the Winged Horse (<i>Pegasus</i>), upside down, as usual.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the northeast, <i>Andromeda</i>, the Chained Lady, is rising,
her head marked by the star &alpha; (which was also called &delta;
of <i>Pegasus</i>). (The "Square of Pegasus" is formed by &alpha; of
<i>Andromeda</i> and &alpha;, &beta;, and &gamma; of <i>Pegasus</i>.)
</p>

<p class="indent">
Between the north and northeast is <i>Cassiopeia</i>, the Seated
Lady, and above her, her husband, King <i>Cepheus</i>. And lastly
<i>Perseus</i> is just rising, between the north and northeast.

The Great Bear (<i>Ursa Major</i>) is low down, between northwest
and north, the Pointers (&alpha; and &beta;) directed slantingly
upward toward the Pole. A line from the Pole Star (&alpha; of the
Little Bear, <i>Ursa Minor</i>) to the Guardians of the Pole (&beta;
and &gamma;), is in the position of the minute hand of a clock
12 minutes before an hour. Between the Great Bear and the Little
Bear run the stars of the Dragon (<i>Draco</i>), round the Little
Bear toward the north, thence toward the northwest, where we see
the head of the Dragon high up, its two bright eyes, &beta; and
&gamma;, directed toward <i>Hercules</i>, which occupies the western
mid-heaven. Above Hercules is <i>Lyra</i>, the Lyre, with the bright
steel-blue star Vega high up toward the point overhead. Right overhead
is the Swan (<i>Cygnus</i>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
Low down in the northwest we see in the chart one star of the Hunting
Dogs (<i>Canes Venatici</i>). Nearer the west stands the Herdsman,
rather slanting forward, however, with the Crown (<i>Corona
Borealis</i>) on his left, almost due west. The long winding Serpent
(<i>Serpens</i>) runs from near the Crown (where we see its head due
west) to farther south than southwest, high up on the western side
of the Serpent Holder (<i>Serpentarius</i> or <i>Ophiuchus</i>),
now standing upright in the southwest. Low down creeps the Scorpion
(<i>Scorpio</i>), its heart Antares, rival of Mars, in the southwest,
the end of its tail between south and southwest. Above and south
of the Scorpion's tail we see the Archer (<i>Sagittarius</i>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
Due south, and high up, is the Eagle (<i>Aquila</i>), its tail at
&zeta; and &epsilon;, its head at &theta;, the bright steel-blue
Altair marking its body. On the left, or east, of the Eagle lies
the neat little Dolphin (<i>Delphinus</i>). Midway between the
Dolphin and the horizon is the tip of the tail of the Sea Goat
(<i>Capricornus</i>), whose head lies nearly due south.
</p>

<p class="indent">
On the southern horizon is the head of the Indian (<i>Indus</i>);
on its left a part of the Crane (<i>Grus</i>), and low down in
the southeast lies Fomalhaut, the chief brilliant of the Southern
Fish (<i>Piscis Australis</i>). Above lies the Water Bearer
(<i>Aquarius</i>), in the southwestern mid-heaven.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Due east, fairly high, is "the Square of Pegasus," the head of the
Winged Horse, Pegasus lying close by the Water Pitcher of Aquarius
(marked by the stars &zeta;, &gamma;, and &alpha;).
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Fishes (<i>Pisces</i>) are low down in the east. A few stars
of the Whale (<i>Cetus</i>) are seen on their right, very low down.
On the left of Pisces we see the Ram (<i>Aries</i>), low down; above
it the Triangle; and above that the Chained Lady (<i>Andromeda</i>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
Low down in the northeast is the Rescuing Knight (<i>Perseus</i>);
above whom is <i>Cassiopeia</i>, and on her left, higher up, the
inconspicuous constellation <i>Cepheus</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Lastly, immediately below <i>Cepheus</i>, we find the Camelopard,
below which, very low down, between north and northeast, is the
Charioteer (<i>Auriga</i>), the brilliant Capella being just above
the horizon.
</p>

<h2><a name="page_32"><span class="page">Page 32</span></a>
NIGHT SKY.&mdash;SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER.</h2>

<hr>

<p class="indent">
Low down, between north and northwest, we find the seven stars
of the Dipper, the Pointers on the right nearly due north. They
direct us to the Pole Star. The Guardians of the Pole (&beta; and
&gamma; of the Little Bear, <i>Ursa Minor</i>) lie in a direction
from the Pole Star corresponding to that of the minute hand of a
clock about 17 minutes before an hour. Between the Pointers and the
Pole Star we find the tip of the Dragon's tail: then passing round
the Little Bear with the Dragon's long train of third magnitude stars,
we come, after a bend, to the Dragon's head, with the two bright
eyes, &alpha; and &beta;&mdash;(part of the Dragon's nose has been
borrowed by Hercules). These two stars are almost exactly midway
between the horizon and the point overhead, and nearly northwest.
King Cepheus&mdash;not a very conspicuous constellation&mdash;lies
between the point overhead and the Little Bear.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Low down in the northwest we find the head of the Herdsman
(<i>Bo&ouml;tes</i>). The Crown (<i>Corona Borealis</i>), which no
one can mistake, lies on his left; and close by is the setting head
of the Serpent. Above these three groups we see Hercules&mdash;the
Kneeler&mdash;his head at &alpha;, his upraised club by &gamma;.
Above the head of Hercules we find the Lyre, with the bright star
Vega; and above that the Swan.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Passing southward, we see the Serpent-Holder (<i>Serpentarius</i>
or <i>Ophiuchus</i>), beyond whom lies the Serpent's tail; a most
inconvenient arrangement, as the Serpent is divided into two parts.
Almost exactly southeast, and low down, are the stars of the Archer
(<i>Sagittarius</i>); while above, in the mid-sky, we see the Eagle
(<i>Aquila</i>), with the bright Altair. Note the neat little
constellation the Dolphin (<i>Delphinus</i>), close by.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Due south is the Crane (<i>Grus</i>); above it the Southern Fish, with
the bright star Fomalhaut. Above that the Sea Goat (<i>Capricornus</i>),
and on the left of this the Water Bearer (<i>Aquarius</i>); one can
recognize his water pitcher, marked by the stars &beta;, &gamma;,
and &alpha;.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Toward the west, high up, is the Winged Horse (<i>Pegasus</i>); he
is upside down just now. Below lies the Whale (<i>Cetus</i>), or
rather the Sea Monster. I have my own notion about Cetus, regarding
him as an icthyosaurus: but that is neither here nor there. The star
&omicron; of this constellation is called Mira; it is a wonderful
variable star. The Fishes (<i>Pisces</i>) may be seen between the
Whale and Pegasus. Few constellations have suffered more than Pisces
by the breaking up of star groups. The Fishes themselves are now
lost in Andromeda and Pegasus.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Note how on the left of Pisces the Ram (<i>Aries</i>) "bears aloft"
Andromeda, the Chained Lady (whose head lies at &alpha;), as Milton
set Aries doing long since. The Triangles serve only as a saddle.
Between Andromeda and her father, Cepheus, we find her mother,
Cassiopeia, or rather Cassiopeia's Chair. (Of course &beta;, &alpha;,
and &gamma; mark the chair's back.) Perseus, the Rescuer, lies below;
&beta; is the famous variable <i>Algol</i>. Below him lies the Bull
(<i>Taurus</i>), with the Pleiades and the bright Aldebaran. Low
down to the left of the Bull, we find the Charioteer (<i>Auriga</i>),
with the bright Capella. And lastly, anyone who likes may admire
the Camelopard (<i>Camelopardalis</i>), between the Great Bear,
Cepheus, and the Charioteer.

The Dipper lies low, the Pointers a little east of north. They
direct to the Pole Star. The Guardians of the Pole (&beta; and
&gamma; of the Little Bear, <i>Ursa Minor</i>) lie in a direction
from the pole star corresponding to that of the minute hand of a
clock about 22 minutes before an hour. Between the Pointers and
Pole Star lies the tip of the Dragon's Tail. Sweeping around the
Little Bear (<i>Ursa Minor</i>) we find the stars of the Dragon
(<i>Draco</i>) curving back by the star &delta; to the Dragon's
Head, with the two bright eyes, &gamma; and &beta;. Above is the
inconspicuous constellation Cepheus; and somewhat higher, the stars
of Cassiopeia, &alpha; and &beta;, marking the top rail of the
Seated Lady's Chair.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Low down in the northwest Hercules is setting. Above is the Lyre,
with the bright steel-blue Vega; and above that the stars of the
Swan (<i>Cygnus</i>), which has sometimes been called the Northern
Cross.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Nearly due west we find the Eagle (<i>Aquila</i>), &zeta; and &epsilon;
marking its tail, &theta; the head. Above the Eagle is the pretty
little constellation <i>Delphinus</i>, the Dolphin.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the southwest, rather low, is the Sea Goat (<i>Capricornus</i>);
above and to the south of him the Water Bearer (<i>Aquarius</i>),
with his pitcher, marked by the stars, &alpha;, &gamma;, and &zeta;.
The head of the Winged Horse, <i>Pegasus</i>, now upside down (in
fact, he is seldom otherwise), is just above this group. The "Square
of Pegasus" will be noticed high up, due south. The star &alpha;
of Andromeda, one of the corners of this square, used to be also
called &delta; of Pegasus.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Much attention need not be directed to the Ph&oelig;nix, low in
the southern horizon. The River <i>Eridanus</i> is coming well into
view; and the great Sea Monster (<i>Cetus</i>) now shows finely,
his head at &alpha; and &gamma;, his paddles at &zeta; and &tau;.
The Fishes (<i>Pisces</i>) are above; the Ram (<i>Aries</i>) above
them and eastward, lying toward the southeast; then the Triangle
(<i>Triangula</i>, or the Triangles, according to modern maps),
and the Chained Lady (<i>Andromeda</i>) too nearly overhead to be
very pleasantly observed. The great nebula in which the new star
recently appeared is near the point overhead.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The grand giant Orion is rising in the east; above him the Bull
(<i>Taurus</i>) with the Pleiades. Low down in the northeast the Twins
(<i>Gemini</i>) are rising; above is the Charioteer (<i>Auriga</i>),
and above him the Rescuing Knight (<i>Perseus</i>), "of fair-haired
Danae born." The Camelopard is hardly worth noticing, except as
marking a barren region of the heavens.

The Great Bear (<i>Ursa Major</i>) is beginning to rise above the
northeast (by north) horizon. The end of the Dipper's handle is
hidden. A line from the Pole Star (toward which the Pointers direct
the observer) to the Guardians of the pole (&beta; and &gamma; of
the Little Bear, <i>Ursa Minor</i>), is now in the position of
the minute hand of a clock 27 minutes before an hour. The stars
of the Dragon wind round below the Little Bear toward the west,
the head of the Dragon with the gleaming eyes ("oblique retorted
that askant cast gleaming fire") being low down, a little north
of northwest. Above is King Cepheus, and above him his queen, the
Seated Lady (<i>Cassiopeia</i>); their daughter, the Chained Lady
(<i>Andromeda</i>) being nearly overhead.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Low down in the northwest we see the Lyre (<i>Lyra</i>), with the
bright Vega; and close by toward the west the Swan (<i>Cygnus</i>),
or Northern Cross. The Eagle is setting in the west, and the Little
Dolphin nears the western horizon.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Toward the southwest (by west) we see the Water Bearer
(<i>Aquarius</i>), with his pitcher (&beta;, &gamma;, &alpha;),
close by which is the head of the Winged Horse (<i>Pegasus</i>).
In the south, low down, is the absurd Ph&oelig;nix; above, the Sea
Monster, or Whale (<i>Cetus</i>); above him, the Fishes (<i>Pisces</i>);
above them, the Ram (<i>Aries</i>); while nearly overhead lies the
Triangle, in reality the Triangles (<i>Triangula</i>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
The River (<i>Eridanus</i>) occupies the southeasterly sky. The
Dove and Great Dog (<i>Columba</i> and <i>Canis Major</i>) are
rising in the southeast. The glorious <i>Orion</i> has now come well
into view, though not yet so upright as we could wish a knightly
hunter to be. He treads on the Hare (<i>Lepus</i>), and faces the
Bull (<i>Taurus</i>) above.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Due east we find the Crab (<i>Cancer</i>), and Little Dog (<i>Canis
Minor</i>) low down; the Twins (<i>Gemini</i>) higher; above them
the Charioteer (<i>Auriga</i>), with the bright <i>Capella</i>,
and <i>Perseus</i> the Rescuer nearing the point overhead. In the
mid-space between <i>Perseus, Auriga</i>, and the two Bears, we find
the ridiculous constellation <i>Camelopardus</i>, or the Giraffe.
